        <h4>SAE – Very Bad Split: Event Finance Management Web App</h4>
        <p>
          A full-stack event budgeting application developed in PHP (MVC-S), enhanced with a custom-built JavaScript
          reactivity library and a REST API.
          Users can create events, invite members, log expenses, and calculate debt balances automatically based on
          individual participation in shared expenses.
          The project originated from a flawed application with security holes, a single-table database, and no
          separation of concerns. We completely restructured and rebuilt the system.
        </p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleDetails('projetVBS', this)">Show Details</button>
        <div id="projetVBS" class="hidden">
          <p>
            <strong>Project Context:</strong> The original app had no architecture, was riddled with vulnerabilities,
            and used a database not even in First Normal Form.
            The challenge was to audit, refactor and secure the code, normalize the database step-by-step, and modernize
            the interface with reactivity and asynchronous API calls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>My Role & Responsibilities:</strong> I analyzed and documented security flaws (SQLi, XSS, weak
            authentication),
            redesigned and normalized the database schema into 3NF with justification,
            implemented the application’s core services and API endpoints in PHP,
            and developed the reactivity layer in JavaScript to make the UI fully interactive without page reloads.
            I also participated in the virtualisation of the project using Docker Compose.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> PHP (MVC-S), JavaScript, custom reactive library, MySQL, Docker, Docker
            Compose, REST API, Twig, AJAX.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skills Developed:</strong>
          <ul class="squareListe">
            <li>Audited application quality and security, then proposed and applied structural improvements (AC3).</li>
            <li>Reconstructed a database model by applying normalization (1NF → 3NF) with documented decompositions
              (AC1).</li>
            <li>Implemented secure back-end architecture and REST API with JWT authentication (AC3, CE1.06).</li>
            <li>Created a dynamic user interface with a custom reactive JavaScript layer and API consumption (AC2, AC4).
            </li>
            <li>Applied the MVC-S architecture and introduced modular services and unit tests with PHPUnit (AC3, AC4).
            </li>
            <li>Used Docker and Docker Compose for complete service virtualization and environment consistency (CE1.06).
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> This project was a deep dive into professional refactoring practices.
            It reinforced my skills in code quality, security, database modeling, API design, frontend/backend
            decoupling, and full-stack project deployment through containerization.

        <h4>Skull – Online 3D Bluff Game</h4>
        <p>
          A browser-based 3D remake of the board game Skull, created just after my internship by reusing and expanding
          the technologies I had learned.
          The game emphasizes strategy and bluff mechanics, all within a modern and scalable architecture.
        </p>
        <button class="button" onclick="toggleDetails('projetSkull', this)">Show Details</button>
        <div id="projetSkull" class="hidden">
          <p>
            <strong>Project Context:</strong> This solo project was designed as a full 3D online multiplayer version of
            the game Skull,
            a strategic game of bluff and betting. The goal was to reproduce the gameplay faithfully while experimenting
            with modern frontend/backend architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>My Role & Responsibilities:</strong> I developed the entire frontend in React with Three.js for 3D
            rendering and styled it using Tailwind CSS.
            The back-end was initially prototyped in TypeScript, then completely reimplemented in Java using a
            <strong>hexagonal architecture</strong>
            to ensure loose coupling and testability.
            I designed the domain logic around SOLID principles to support scalability and code clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> React, Three.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Java, Hexagonal architecture,
            WebSocket (for real-time communication).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Skills Developed:</strong>
          <ul class="squareListe">
            <li>Reused technologies from my internship in a new project context to reinforce my learning (AC1).</li>
            <li>Applied modern frontend frameworks and 3D engines to create an interactive and immersive user experience
              (AC2, CE1.03).</li>
            <li>Designed a modular back-end with clear domain logic using the hexagonal architecture and SOLID
              principles (AC3, CE1.06).</li>
            <li>Validated the system through component testing and real-time gameplay debugging (AC4).</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> This project helped me solidify the architectural concepts discovered during
            my internship,
            deepen my mastery of 3D rendering for the web, and explore advanced back-end design patterns in Java.
